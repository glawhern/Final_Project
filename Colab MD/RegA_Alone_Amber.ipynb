To build our simulation box, we will use LEaP program (https://ambermd.org/tutorials/pengfei/index.php). The LEaP program is a portal between many chemical structure file types (.pdb and .mol2, primarily), and the Amber model parameter file types such as .lib, .prepi, parm.dat, and .frcmod. Each of the parameter files contains pieces of information needed for constructing a simulation, whether for energy minimization or molecular dynamics. LEaP functions within a larger workflow described in Section 1.1 of the [Amber Manual](https://ambermd.org/doc12/Amber20.pdf);.\n","##
