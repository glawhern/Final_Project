To build our simulation box, we will use LEaP program (https://ambermd.org/tutorials/pengfei/index.php). The LEaP program is a portal between many chemical structure file types (.pdb and .mol2, primarily), and the Amber model parameter file types such as .lib, .prepi, parm.dat, and .frcmod. Each of the parameter files contains pieces of information needed for constructing a simulation, whether for energy minimization or molecular dynamics. LEaP functions within a larger workflow described in Section 1.1 of the [Amber Manual](https://ambermd.org/doc12/Amber20.pdf);.\n","##

here is the **Number_of_strides** and the **Stride_Time**. In this notebook, we simulate a defined number of *strides*, so the **simulation time = Number_of_strides*Stride_Time**. For example, we can simulate 100ns by setting *Number_of_strides=10* and *Stride_Time=10 ns*.\n","\n","**Important: at the end of the Production simulation, we concatenate all strides to create a complete trajectory file which can be visualized and analyzed**\n","\n","The idea behind this approach is to make use of the intermitent 12h/24h period that Google Colab allows us to use its GPUs."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Z0JV6Zid50_o","cellView":"form"},"source":["#@markdown ### **Provide input file names below:**\n","\n","Equilibrated_PDB = 'RegA_equil.pdb' #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","State_file = 'RegA_equil.rst' #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","\n","#@markdown ---\n","#@markdown ### **Parameters for MD Production protocol:**\n","\n","\n","# remove whitespaces\n","Jobname = 'RegA_prod' #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","\n","#@markdown Simulation time (in nanoseconds), number of strides (integers) and integration timestep (in femtoseconds):\n","Stride_Time = \"5\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","stride_time_prod = Stride_Time\n","Number_of_strides = \"10\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","nstride = Number_of_strides\n","Integration_timestep = \"2\" #@param [\"0.5\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\"]\n","dt_prod = Integration_timestep\n","\n","#@markdown Temperature (in Kelvin) and Pressure (in bar)\n","Temperature = \"300\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","temperature_prod = Temperature\n","Pressure = 1 #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","pressure_prod = Pressure\n","\n","#@markdown Frequency to write the trajectory file (in picoseconds):\n","Write_the_trajectory = \"10\" #@param [\"10\", \"100\", \"200\", \"500\", \"1000\"]\n","write_the_trajectory_prod = Write_the_trajectory\n","\n","#@markdown Frequency to write the log file (in picoseconds):\n","Write_the_log = \"10\" #@param [\"10\", \"100\", \"200\", \"500\", \"1000\"]\n","write_the_log_prod = Write_the_log\n","\n","#@markdown ---"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0QcjKSoqHHhi","cellView":"form","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1715961624057,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":4196122,"user":{"displayName":"Grace Lawhern","userId":"01155170814155400547"}},"outputId":"dbd1e01b-5208-410f-d837-92fd557da135"},"source":["#@title **Runs a Production MD simulation (NPT ensemble) after equilibration**\n","#\n","###########################################\n","import openmm as mm\n","from openmm import *\n","from openmm.app import *\n","from openmm.unit import *\n","\n","from sys import stdout, exit, stderr\n","import os, math, fnmatch\n","\n","#############################################\n","# Defining MD simulation parameters\n","\n","jobname = os.path.join(workDir, str(Jobname))\n","coordinatefile = os.path.join(workDir, \"SYS.crd\")\n","pdbfile = os.path.join(workDir, Equilibrated_PDB)\n","topologyfile = os.path.join(workDir, \"SYS.prmtop\")\n","equil_rst_file = os.path.join(workDir, State_file)\n","\n","\n","stride_time_ps = float(stride_time_prod)*1000\n","stride_time = float(stride_time_ps)*picosecond\n","nstride = int(Number_of_strides)\n","dt = int(dt_prod)*femtosecond\n","temperature = float(temperature_prod)*kelvin\n","savcrd_freq = int(write_the_trajectory_prod)*picosecond\n","print_freq  = int(write_the_log_prod)*picosecond\n","\n","pressure\t= float(pressure_prod)*bar\n","\n","simulation_time = stride_time*nstride\n","nsteps  = int(stride_time.value_in_unit(picosecond)/dt.value_in_unit(picosecond))\n","nprint  = int(print_freq.value_in_unit(picosecond)/dt.value_in_unit(picosecond))\n","nsavcrd = int(savcrd_freq.value_in_unit(picosecond)/dt.value_in_unit(picosecond))\n","firststride = 1 #
