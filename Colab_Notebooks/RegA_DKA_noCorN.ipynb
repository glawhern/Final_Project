To build our simulation box, we will use LEaP program (https://ambermd.org/tutorials/pengfei/index.php). The LEaP program is a portal between many chemical structure file types (.pdb and .mol2, primarily), and the Amber model parameter file types such as .lib, .prepi, parm.dat, and .frcmod. Each of the parameter files contains pieces of information needed for constructing a simulation, whether for energy minimization or molecular dynamics. LEaP functions within a larger workflow described in Section 1.1 of the [Amber Manual](https://ambermd.org/doc12/Amber20.pdf).\n","\n","To build ligand topology we will use general AMBER force field (GAFF - http://ambermd.org/antechamber/gaff.html). GAFF is compatible with the AMBER force field and it has parameters for almost all the organic molecules made of C, N, O, H, S, P, F, Cl, Br and I. As a complete force field, GAFF is suitable for study of a great number of molecules in an automatic fashion.\n","\n","You can download the input files examples from [here](https://github.com/pablo-arantes/making-it-rain/tree/main/PROTEIN_LIGAND);\n","## ---\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Lh96y6mGFY1D"},"source":["---\n","---\n","# **Setting the environment for MD calculation**\n","\n","Firstly, we need to install all necessary libraries and packages for our simulation.
