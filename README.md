Final Update: 
Here I have uploaded all of my work for the final project, including failed initial attempts. I have the production files in the Production folder with subfolders for each protein-ligand complex. I have my analyses compiled in the Analysis folder with subfolders for output organization. Here you will find the notebooks where I did my calculations and made my plots.  My final presentation is also here. 
Thank you for a great term!
